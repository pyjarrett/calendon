Rename DynamicBuffer -> ContiguousDynamicBuffer

Put LogHandles in headers for things which might need them to be reusable: e.g. `extern LogHandle LogSysAssets;`

Mem_Allocate should probably return a bool indicating success or failure.

Remove KN_ASSERT for non-debug builds.

Rename KN_PATH_MAX -> KN_MAX_PATH
